# Requirements
## Create UML and Design
Create a UML of the starter code using a UML tool. The UML consists of classes and methods/attributes from the starter code. Also write design of the classes in the plan.
## Implement design from starter code
Fill in the code from the starter code. Implement attributes and methods to make Bingo! run properly.

# Design
## UserInterface
Finish the constructor. Get input from the user to generate a deck in the createDeck() method.
Combine all classes into a seemlessly simple interface.

## Card
Finish the constructor. Return the correct values in the get methods. generateCard() to create Card's interface.
__str__() displays the card.

## Deck
Finish the constructor. Return the correct value for the getCardCount() method.

## NumberSet
Finish the constructor. Return correct values in the get methods. randomize() will use python's built in list method, shuffle() to randomize the data.
getNext() uses a data member, increment, to get the next available number in the numberset. get() uses the index to index into numberset.

# Implementation
Implementation was simple fill in the gaps.
# Validation/Verification
## Unit Tests
The unit tests that were provided were used to test code. Each class passed the tests.

## Visual Output
Check the visual output to the stdout. If similar to given example multiple times, code is validated.
