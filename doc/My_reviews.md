## UML
Looking Jase's diagram and plan, he seems to have a solid grasp of the system as I understand it. `UserInterface` creates instances of `Menu` and `Deck`. The diagram also displays all methods found in the starter code, along with the proper visibility modifiers. It depends on both the `Menu` and `Deck` classes. Each method has the specified return type.

The `Menu` class displays all the necessary components. It has the private access properties and contains the correct methods found in the starter code. Each method has the specified return type. The `Menu` class creates instances of `MenuOption` and aggregates them.

The `MenuOption` class displays all the necessary components. It has the private access properties and contains the correct methods found in the starter code. Each method has the specified return type.

The `Deck` class displays all the necessary components. It has the private access properties and contains the correct methods found in the starter code. Each method has the specified return type. The `Deck` class creates instances of `Card` and aggregates them. Each `Deck` instance relies on the tools in the `NumberSet`.

The `Card` class displays all the necessary components. It has the private access properties and contains the correct methods found in the starter code. Each method has the specified return type. Each `Card` instance relies on the tools in the `NumberSet` to populate its set of numbers.

The `NumberSet` class displays all the necessary components. It has the private access properties and contains the correct methods found in the starter code. Each method has the specified return type.







Peer Review From Jacob Sorenson:


Jase, you did an excellent job with your UML diagram. The formatting was perfect, using the draw.io tool shown to us by Erik. You had all of your straight boxes and lines, along with the correct dotted or solid lines, as well as the correct labels and arrows for each. You seem to really understand how all of this works. I feel like I agree with you on a lot of the different types of arrows that you have used, showing dependency and association, and I really liked how you did the 3 to 10000 part between the deck and card. 
Overall, you did an excellent job and I donâ€™t know anymore that you could do, besides making sure that you keep it up to date with your code and your plan.
