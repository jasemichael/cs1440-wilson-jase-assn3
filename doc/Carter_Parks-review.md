Upon review, the UML diagram looks acceptable; all classes are present with their corresponding data members and methods. At a closer look, the classes contain the correct data members and methods. The UserInterface classes' data members also include methods for obtaining user input. Each class also includes the constructor. The Hungarian notation data members are also included in the Deck, NumberSet, and Menu classes. However, there are components missing. The visibility for each data member and methods are missing. The only hint at visibility is the __ marking for python. In addition, the methods are missing paramters and their corresponding data types. Methods, other than the void methods, are missing the return type. For the relationships, each is associative. Some relationships should be dependencies because the classes create and use them in the declaration. Also, the associative relationships are missing the verb to identify how the relationship works. To explain, a UserInterface is connected to a deck and menu, but how are they related? There is no way to identify the relationship without the verb keyword. Also, multiplicity is in effect, but some classes are missing its usage. Only Menu and Deck have a 1 to many relationship and the rest of the classes are without this identification. There are various diamond shapes connected to the classes that have a uncommon usage (I don't know why they are used), but cool. Its interesting that all of the classes are connected and are directed to the Bingo.py. I'm not sure if having Bingo apart of the diagram is best practice, but it connects the diagram really well.
