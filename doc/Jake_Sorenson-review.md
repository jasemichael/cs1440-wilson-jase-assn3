The intial view of the document indicates a thorough UML document. Upon further inspection,  data members and methods are present for each class. The UserInterface class is missing the currentDeck data member. That data member should be included in the class to keep track of the deck. Each data member is properly described, having the name, type, and private visibility. For methods, most are described, but some are missing. Getting user input for the UserInterface is missing. Include getNumberInput and getStringInput in the methods for the UserInterface. Additional methods are included. Set methods in the Deck and NumberSet classes are described when not required, which is good. More methods simplify the coding and reduces repetition. The methods in general follow the correct syntax, showing the method, parameters and types, as well as return types. Note: the visibility of the data members/methods are present and the python visibility syntax (__) for methods are present as well. Both are not required; eliminate the __ from the methods and data members to easier identify the classes components (use them in the actual implementation). All classes have relations. Not all relationships have multiplicity. The use of dependency and association varys; dependency is the relationship when a class is used or instantiated within another class; association is a link that doesn't require usage, creation, or deletion. Also, the dependency relationships don't follow the syntax << >>. Final note, be specific with verb usage. A class 'is in' is too generic. Try accumulates or some other verb that specifies that the deck encompasses many cards into a collection.
